## 1. Initialize a Git Repository

To start using Git, you first need to initialize a repository in your project directory. This command creates a `.git` directory where Git stores all information related to your project’s version control.

```bash
git init
```

Once initialized, you will be able to track changes in your project using Git commands.

---

## 2. Add Content to the Repository

After initializing your Git repository, you can start adding files for version control.

- **Add a specific file to the staging area:**

```bash
git add <filename>
```

- **Add all files in the current directory to the staging area:**

```bash
git add .
```

This prepares the files to be committed.

---

## 3. Create Commits

After staging your files, you need to commit them to save the changes in your local repository. A commit captures the state of your project at a certain point.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

> Replace `"Your commit message"` with a meaningful description of the changes you've made.

---

## 4. Check Git Logs

To view the history of commits and track the changes over time, use the following command:

```bash
git log
```

This will display a list of all commits with details such as commit hashes, author information, dates, and commit messages.

# Branching and Merging

## 5. Branching and Merging

### 5.1 Create and Switch Branches

Branching allows you to work on features or bug fixes separately from the `main` branch.

- **Create a new branch:**

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

- **Switch to an existing branch:**

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

- **Create a new branch and switch to it in one step:**

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### 5.2 Merging Branches

After working on a feature in a separate branch, you can merge it back into the `main` branch.

1. **Switch to the `main` branch (or the branch you want to merge into):**

```bash
git checkout main
```

2. **Merge another branch (e.g., `feature-branch`) into `main`:**

```bash
git merge <feature-branch>
```

If there are conflicts during the merge, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually. After resolving conflicts, you can commit the merge.

# Forking and Pull Requests

## 6. Forking and Pull Requests

### 6.1 Forking a Repository

Forking creates a personal copy of someone else's repository on GitHub. This allows you to experiment and make changes without affecting the original project.

1. Navigate to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner of the page.

After forking, you’ll have your own copy of the repository on GitHub.

---

### 6.2 Cloning the Forked Repository

Once you’ve forked a repository, you need to clone it to your local machine to begin making changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repository.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `forked-repository` with the name of your forked repository.

---

### 6.3 Making Changes to the Forked Repository

For this example, let’s say you want to update the `README.md` file:

1. Open the `README.md` file and make changes:

```bash
nano README.md
```

Add a new section or modify existing content as needed.

2. **Stage the changes:**

```bash
git add README.md
```

3. **Commit the changes:**

```bash
git commit -m "Updated the README file"
```

---

### 6.4 Pushing Changes to Your Fork

After making and committing changes, push them back to your forked repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This command will upload your local changes to the `main` branch of your forked repository on GitHub.

---

### 6.5 Creating a Pull Request

Now that you've pushed your changes to your fork, you can create a pull request (PR) to propose your changes to the original repository.

1. Go to the **Pull Requests** tab on the original repository’s GitHub page.
2. Click the **New Pull Request** button.
3. Select your fork and branch, and compare it to the original repository’s `main` branch.
4. Add a description for the PR and click **Create Pull Request**.

The repository maintainers will review your changes and decide whether to merge them into the main project.
